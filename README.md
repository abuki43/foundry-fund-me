# Foundry Fund Me

# About

This is a minimal project allowing users to fund the contract owner with donations. The smart contract accepts ETH as donations, denominated in USD. Donations have a minimal USD value, otherwise they are rejected. The value is priced using a Chainlink price feed, and the smart contract keeps track of doners in case they are to be rewarded in the future.


## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu
cd foundry-fund-me-cu
make
```

## Deploy

```
forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol
```

## Testing

```
forge test
```

or 

```
// Only run test functions matching the specified regex pattern.

"forge test -m testFunctionName" is deprecated. Please use 

forge test --match-test testFunctionName
```

or

```
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

## Local zkSync 

The instructions here will allow you to work with this repo on zkSync.


### Setup local zkSync node 

Run the following:

```bash
npx zksync-cli dev config
```

And select: `In memory node` and do not select any additional modules.

Then run:
```bash
npx zksync-cli dev start
```

And you'll get an output like:
```
In memory node started v0.1.0-alpha.22:
 - zkSync Node (L2):
  - Chain ID: 260
  - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8011
  - Rich accounts: https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/era-test-node.html#use-pre-configured-rich-wallets
```

### Deploy to local zkSync node

```bash
make deploy-zk
```

This will deploy a mock price feed and a fund me contract to the zkSync node.

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.


Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

3. Deploy

```
forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

## Scripts

After deploying to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts. 

Using cast deployed locally example: 

```
cast send <FUNDME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "fund()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

or
```
forge script script/Interactions.s.sol:FundFundMe --rpc-url sepolia  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY  --broadcast
forge script script/Interactions.s.sol:WithdrawFundMe --rpc-url sepolia  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY  --broadcast
```

### Withdraw

```
cast send <FUNDME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "withdraw()"  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`


# Formatting


To run code formatting:
```
forge fmt
```
